Beginner's Guide to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

1. Introduction to AI

Overview of AI and Its Importance
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It encompasses a wide range of technologies that enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Why AI Matters:

Powers technologies like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
Transforms industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment.
Drives innovation through automation and data-driven insights.
Key Concepts and Terminology
Machine Learning (ML): Subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
Deep Learning: A type of ML that uses neural networks with many layers.
Neural Network: A series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain.
Supervised Learning: Training a model on labeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels.
Reinforcement Learning: Training models through rewards and penalties.
